# What is this repository for?
## This is for tracking all the placements progress and the preparation progress

## Estimated For now:

 MONTH 1 — PYTHON + DSA FOUNDATION (FILTER ROUND PREP)
Python (Daily)
Variables, loops, functions


Lists, dicts, sets


OOP: class, object, inheritance


Write code without autocomplete


Dry-run logic on paper


DSA (Daily – Mandatory)
Arrays


Strings


HashMap (dict)


Stack, Queue


Time complexity (O(n), O(log n))


🎯 Target
30–40 LeetCode (Easy → Medium)


You should explain:


Why this approach is O(n)


Why a hashmap is used


❗ Why here?
 This is where most candidates get rejected.
 DSA cannot wait till Month 6.

🔹 MONTH 2 — DATA + SQL + CONTINUED DSA
Data Handling
NumPy operations


Pandas:


Filtering


Grouping


Aggregation


Handling missing values


SQL (Very Important)
SELECT, WHERE


JOIN (INNER, LEFT)


GROUP BY, HAVING


DSA (Continue)
Recursion


Trees (basic)


BFS / DFS (intro)


🎯 Mini Project
Analyze a CSV dataset


Manually write insights:


Trends


Outliers


Possible reasons


🎯 Interview Focus
Explain joins clearly


Explain how you cleaned data



🔹 MONTH 3 — MACHINE LEARNING BASICS (INTERVIEW CORE)
Algorithms (Scikit-learn)
Linear Regression


Logistic Regression


KNN


Decision Trees


Focus (More Important than Code)
Why the algorithm works


When it fails


Assumptions


Mandatory Questions (Must Answer Smoothly)
Bias vs Variance


Overfitting vs Underfitting


Train vs Test split


Why accuracy is not enough


🎯 Outcome
You should explain ML without math symbols


Interviewers care about clarity, not derivations



🔹 MONTH 4 — ADVANCED ML + DEEP LEARNING ENTRY
Advanced ML
Random Forest


K-Means


PCA (intuition-based)


Deep Learning (Minimum Required)
PyTorch basics


Neural networks


Loss functions (intuition)


Backpropagation (conceptual)


Optimizers (Adam)


❌ No heavy math
 ❌ No research papers
🎯 Project 1 (Mandatory)
 Student Performance Prediction
Data cleaning


Feature selection


Compare 3 models


Explain why one is better


🎯 Interview Focus
Why Random Forest > Decision Tree


What PCA actually does



🔹 MONTH 5 — NLP + GEN AI (IBM / INFOSYS FAVORITE)
NLP Foundations
Text preprocessing


TF-IDF


Sentence embeddings


Transformers
What BERT is


Why attention matters


Usage-level understanding


RAG (Very Important)
PDF ingestion


Chunking


Embeddings


Vector DB (FAISS)


LLM response


🎯 Project 2 (Strong Differentiator)
 PDF Question Answering System
LangChain


FAISS


Open-source LLM


🎯 Explain in Interview
Why RAG is needed


How it reduces hallucination


Why embeddings are used



🔹 MONTH 6 — DSA ADVANCED + DEPLOYMENT + MOCKS
DSA (Placement Final Push)
Trees (depth)


Graph BFS/DFS


Sliding window


Two pointers


🎯 Target
Total 120–150 LeetCode


Pattern recognition over brute force



System Design (Basic but Required)
ML pipeline:


Data → Training → Inference


Model deployment idea


Monitoring basics


Deployment (Lightweight)
FastAPI


Model as REST API


Docker awareness (bonus, not mandatory)
